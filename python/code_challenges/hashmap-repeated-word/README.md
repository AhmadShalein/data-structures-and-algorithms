## Hashmap Repeated Word
  * Find the first repeated word in a book.

## Whiteboard Process

<!-- ## Approach & Efficiency
  * Time: O(n.logn)
    - Because the list is being split in log(n) calls and the merging process takes linear time in each call.
  * Space: O(1)
    - This list is being sorted in place, keeping the space at constant O(1).
