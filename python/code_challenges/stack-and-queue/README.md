# Code Challenge 10:

## Stack and Queue

## Challenge:
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.

* Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.

* The class should contain the following methods:
    * push.
    * pop.
    * peek.
    * is empty.

* Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.

* The class should contain the following methods:
    * enqueue.
    * dequeue.
    * peek.
    * is empty.
